Fake Finder is an interactive command-line fact-checking game powered by Wikipedia and Google Gemini AI.
Your mission: identify the fake fact hidden among real ones!

## 🎯 Game Overview

Fake Finder challenges players to distinguish true statements from AI-generated fake ones, based on Wikipedia articles.
Each round presents four sentences — one is false, and three are true.
